detect.py
----------
Placeholder for object detection module in the Wheelz project.

This script will eventually handle:
- Receiving frames from receiver.py
- Running object detection (YOLO, MobileNet, etc.)
- Returning bounding boxes / coordinates of detected objects
- Passing goal positions to the reinforcement learning driver
