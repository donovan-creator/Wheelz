----------
Reinforcement Learning (RL) Driver for the Wheelz robot project.

This module will eventually handle:
- Receiving processed information from the object detection system (detect.py),
  such as the coordinates or labels of target objects.
- Representing the robot's state (e.g., encoder data, IMU readings, camera input).
- Applying a trained reinforcement learning policy (e.g., DQN, PPO, or custom algorithm)
  to decide the next driving action.
- Sending control commands (forward, left, right, stop, etc.) to the robot
  through the communication layer (via phone relay or direct network).
- Optionally logging rewards, states, and actions for evaluation and retraining.
