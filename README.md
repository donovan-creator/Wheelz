# ðŸ¤– Autonomous Robot Car â€“ Core Code

This repository contains the full **software stack** for my self-built autonomous robot car.  
It includes embedded control for motors and sensors, **computer vision/object detection** using OpenCV, and a **reinforcement learning AI** for navigation and decision-making.  
The system integrates with the companion **Toolbox App** for wireless control and relays sensor/camera data to a **PC backend**, where ML models are executed.

## âœ¨ Features
- **Embedded Control:**  
  - Motor control with ESP32 and L298N driver  
  - Sensor fusion with IMU + wheel encoders for position estimation  

- **Computer Vision & Object Detection:**  
  - Camera-based vision pipeline using **OpenCV**  
  - Object detection and lane/path recognition  
  - ML models (PyTorch/TensorFlow) run on PC backend for real-time inference  

- **Reinforcement Learning AI:**  
  - AI agent trained in simulation (Webots/other environment)  
  - Learns optimal navigation strategies through trial and error  
  - Policies deployed to the robot for real-world path following and obstacle avoidance  

- **App + PC Integration:**  
  - **Toolbox App** relays sensor/camera data from robot to PC  
  - PC backend performs **ML inference** and sends decisions back to robot  
  - Distributed design enables heavy AI models to run beyond robotâ€™s onboard hardware
